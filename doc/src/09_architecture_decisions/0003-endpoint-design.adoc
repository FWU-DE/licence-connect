=== ADR 3: Do we integrate Bilo into generic licence endpoint for Licence Provider

Date: 2025-03-15

==== Status

Accepted

==== Context

Ideally, we would like one generic endpoint for all connected licence providers. 
In theory, BiLo is one such licence provider that could be integrated into this endpoint.
In practice, BiLo API endpoints require unique BiLo-specific user IDs in order to request licenses (as opposed to more universal request parameters used by other licence holders, such as federal state).
Additionally, there are two distinct BiLo API versions (v1 and v2) which are currently operating in parallel. 

When designing our API architecture, we needed to determine whether to:

1. Create one truly generic endpoint which handles all licence providers (including BiLo)
2. Create a generic endpoint for most providers plus a separate BiLo endpoint
3. Create a generic endpoint plus separate endpoints for BiLo v1 and BiLo v2

==== Considered Options

===== Option 1: Single Universal Generic Endpoint

**Pros**:
- Single entry point for all licence provider interactions
- Simplest client-side integration with just one endpoint to learn
- Reduced API surface area

**Cons**:
- Creates confusing parameter combinations with pseudo-optional parameters
- Makes documentation unclear about which parameters apply to which providers
- Difficult to maintain as each provider evolves independently

===== Option 2: Generic Endpoint + Single BiLo Endpoint

**Pros**:
- Separates the unique BiLo requirements from other providers
- Reduces endpoint proliferation compared to Option 3
- Acknowledges BiLo's distinct nature while keeping it unified

**Cons**:
- Still forces two very different BiLo API versions into a single endpoint
- Creates ambiguity with parameters that apply to only one BiLo version
- Would require complex version handling logic within the endpoint

===== Option 3: Generic Endpoint + Separate BiLo v1 and v2 Endpoints

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of concerns for each provider and version
- Precise parameter requirements for each endpoint
- Better readability and maintainability of implementation code
- Allows specialized error handling for each provider's unique requirements

**Cons**:
- More endpoints for clients to understand and integrate with
- Potential confusion about which endpoint to use
- Some duplication of shared logic across endpoints

==== Decision

We choose Option 3 (Generic Endpoint + Separate BiLo v1 and v2 Endpoints) for the following reasons:

1. BiLo APIs are fundamentally incompatible with our generic approach:
    - They require specialized parameter handling that doesn't fit our generic model, i.e., the BiLo user ids
    - Their response formats differ significantly from our standard structure

2. The two BiLo versions (v1 and v2) themselves have major incompatibilities:
    - Parameter structures and response formats differ significantly between versions
    - They run in parallel production environments

3. Clear API design benefits:
    - Each endpoint has unambiguous parameter requirements
    - Documentation can be precise about what each endpoint expects
    - Error handling can be tailored to each provider's specific failure modes

4. Implementation clarity:
    - Clean separation in code between different provider integrations
    - Each endpoint can evolve independently as provider APIs change
    - Testing is more straightforward with clearly defined boundaries

==== Consequences

- The API exposes multiple endpoints with different purposes and parameter requirements
- Clients must determine which endpoint best suits their specific licence provider needs
- Documentation must clearly explain the purpose and requirements of each endpoint
- Future provider integrations will not follow this pattern, every integration will have to fit the generic model
- Maintenance will be easier as changes to one provider's integration won't affect others
