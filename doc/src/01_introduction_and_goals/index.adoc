== Introduction and Goals

Licence Connect Core is a "licence broker". 
It is connected to several licence holding systems and can return all relevant licences for a user.

=== Requirements Overview

Licence Connect Core is supposed to:

* retrieve licence information from different sources (aka licence holding systems)
* unify the retrieved licence information in a generic format (ODRL, see <<adr5>>)
* enable VIDIS to retrieve licence information for specific users and clients (aka licence consumers)
* enable administrators to enable or disable sources for specific clients
