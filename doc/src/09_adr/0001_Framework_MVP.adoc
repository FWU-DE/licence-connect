## ADR 0001: Primary framework for the "Licence Connect" MVP

Date: 2024-04-26

### Status

Draft

### Context

For the start of the "Licence Connect" (LC) project we need to develop an MVP.
For this, we need to choose a suitable framework.
The scope of the MVP will be to provide a REST-API and make calls to other REST-APIs.
Currently no data persistence or UI is needed.
Due to limited time and budget the framework to choose should provide as much development velocity as possible.
Nevertheless, a high level of extensability is desirable as the MVP is the foundation of a fully functional LC system.

### Considered Options

#### Liferay DXP

The link:https://www.liferay.com/de/resources/product-info/Liferay+DXP%3A+The+Complete+Platform+for+Tailored+Solutions[Liferay DXP] infrastructure and technology is used in the VIDIS Portal project.
One possible solution for LC would be the reuse of the VIDIS Portal infrastructure.

*Pros*:

* Reuse of Liferay DXP

*Cons*:

* Would intertwine the two link:https://www.digitalpaktschule.de/de/digitalpakt-schule-landerubergreifende-vorhaben-1848.html[LÃ¼Vs] of VIDIS and LC more than necessary
* Stronger coupling with VIDIS Portal developer team
* Liferay DXP is a commercial product with costs
* Documentation of Liferay itself and VIDIS Portal is lackluster right now
* Small pool of developers experienced with Liferay globally
* Many techniques in Liferay do not follow DevOps approaches
* Lower familiarity on dev side compared with Node.js based approaches

#### express.js

The MVP could be realized in link:https://expressjs.com[express.js], a very lightweight web framework for Node.js.

*Pros*:

* Lightweight solution for building a simple API

*Cons*:

* Extensability is lower compared to the other considered options.
* It does not provide more than the possibility to provide endpoints.
Everything else has to be added manually with different libraries.
* Lack of a preexisting architecture enabling growth into a bigger system.

#### NestJS

Another alternative is link:https://nestjs.com/[NestJS], an express-based framework for scalable and extensible Node.js applications.

*Pros*:

* Rich ecosystem with easy to use extensions (Swagger, Validations, ORMs)
* Module system with dependency injection for clean structure
* Structure and architecture suitable for growing bigger

*Cons*:

* More setup effort than express

#### ASP.NET Core

Another possibility is link:https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet[ASP.NET Core], a framework for building web apps and services with .NET and C#.

*Pros*:

* Compiled language (C#) with a statistically higher performance than Node.js-based frameworks
* Strongly typed language offers reduced errors in the development process
* Highly extensible via the .net eco-system

*Cons*:

* Slower development velocity due to compilation
* Higher setup effort compared to Node.js-based development
* Heavier than Node.js-based frameworks

### Decision

Use NestJS because it has a relatively simple setup, high development speed and is easy to extend.

### Consequences

The LC project will use TypeScript and NestJS as its backbone, at least for the MVP.
The MVP will not provide its own UI out of the box.
The Liferay infrastructure of VIDIS Portal will not be reused unless absolutely necessary.
Every communication between VIDIS and LC will require some sort of API.
