## ADR 0001: Using NestJS as the primary framwork for the LicenceConnect Project 

Date: 2024-04-25

### Status

Accepted

### Context

* API-Framework
* No Data persistance
* Extensibility
* High Development Velocity

### Considered Options

#### Liferay DXP

The Liferay DXP infrastructure and technology is used in the VIDIS Portal project.
One possible solution for LicenceConnect would be the reuse of the VIDIS Portal infrastructure.

*Pros*:
* Reuse of Liferay DXP

*Cons*:
* Does not conform to seperations of LÃ¼V
* Stronger Coupling with VIDIS Core Developer Team
* Commercial Product
* Different, incomplete Versions of Documentation

#### express.js

*Pros*:
* Lightweight solution for building a simple API

*Cons*:
* Extensability is lower compared to the other considered options
* lack of a common structure for bigger systems

#### NestJS

*Pros*:
* Rich ecosystem with easy to use extensions (Swagger, Validations, ORMs)
* Module system with dependency injection for cleaner structure
* Common structure suitable for production systems

*Cons*:
* More setup effort than express

#### ASP.net Core

*Pros*:
* Compiled Language (C#) with a statically higher performance than JavaScript-based Frameworks
* Strongly typed language offers reduces errors in the development process
* Highly extensible via the .net eco-system

*Cons*:
* Slower development velocity due to compilation
* Higher setup effort than javascript based development
* Heavier than JavaScript based Frameworks

### Decision

Use NestJs because it has a relatively simple setup, high development speed and is easy to extend.

### Consequences
