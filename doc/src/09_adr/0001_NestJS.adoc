## ADR 0001: Using NestJS as the primary framwork for the LicenceConnect Project 

Date: 2024-04-26

### Status

Draft

### Context

For the Start of the LicenceConnect Project we need a Framework for licence connect.
This Framework should provide API-Functionality.
Currently no data persistance is needed, nevertheless, a high level of extensability is required as this project should be the foundation of a fully functional LicenceConnect system.
Due to limited time and budget the Framework to choose should provide as mutch development velocity as possible. 

### Considered Options

#### Liferay DXP

The Liferay DXP infrastructure and technology is used in the VIDIS Portal project.
One possible solution for LicenceConnect would be the reuse of the VIDIS Portal infrastructure.

*Pros*:
* Reuse of Liferay DXP

*Cons*:
* Does not conform to seperations of LÃ¼V
* Stronger Coupling with VIDIS Core Developer Team
* Liferay DXP is a Commercial Product
* Different, incomplete Versions of Documentation
* Lower familiarity on dev side compared with JavaScript based approaches

#### express.js

*Pros*:
* Lightweight solution for building a simple API

*Cons*:
* Extensability is lower compared to the other considered options
* lack of a common structure for bigger systems

#### NestJS

*Pros*:
* Rich ecosystem with easy to use extensions (Swagger, Validations, ORMs)
* Module system with dependency injection for cleaner structure
* Common structure suitable for production systems

*Cons*:
* More setup effort than express

#### ASP.net Core

*Pros*:
* Compiled Language (C#) with a statically higher performance than JavaScript-based Frameworks
* Strongly typed language offers reduces errors in the development process
* Highly extensible via the .net eco-system

*Cons*:
* Slower development velocity due to compilation
* Higher setup effort than javascript based development
* Heavier than JavaScript based Frameworks

### Decision

Use NestJs because it has a relatively simple setup, high development speed and is easy to extend.

### Consequences

The Licence Project will use TypeScript and NestJS as its backbone.
The Liferay infrastructure will not be reused.
Every Communication between VIDIS and LC will require some sort of API.
