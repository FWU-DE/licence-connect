# LicenceConnect

## Getting Started

### Local Setup

#### Running in the console

1. Clone the repository
2. Select the correct node version if necessary (the Dockerfile currently uses node:20)
3. Run `yarn install` in the root directory (if yarn is not yet installed on your machine, install it first)
4. `cd licence-connect`
5. `npm run start`

Once the application is started and the dependencies are initialised (should only take a few seconds), you should be able to access the swagger UI locally in your browser via `localhost:3000/swagger`

#### VS Code

If you use VS Code for development, you can install the recommended extensions from the popup showing up, as soon as you open the project folder. 

### Deployed Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `cd docker`
3. Run `cp .env.example .env`
4. Enter your configuration in the `.env` file
5. Authenticate with the container registry
6. Run `docker compose up -d`
7. Open `<your-url>/swagger` to get an overview of available endpoints
